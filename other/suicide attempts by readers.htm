<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I didn't intend to drown myself but to swim until I
wore out.&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Except, that I took
three bottles of pills first to make the journey more comfortable because if
you've ever experienced air deprivation (contrary to some opinions) it is very,
very distressful and I didn't want to suffer through the suffocation.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The problem was I passed out before I reached
the water (I'm normally an adequate swimmer) and was finally checked on by the <span

<p class=MsoNormal>The rest of the story is pretty ordinary from there.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If I had had a bit of clear-headedness when I
woke up, chances are I wouldn't have been locked up as long as I was because
they couldn't find anything in my blood (I guess I chose a good combination of
prescription medicines) and it was all a mystery to them what was the matter
with me.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The day I left the hospital,
they were still trying to figure out why I'd done it because I never did
explain that.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was just while I was semi-conscious
that I admitted to what I'd done because I'm just too honest for my own
good.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Had I feigned ignorance, I would
have gone down as someone with some mysterious <span class=SpellE>syncopic</span>
and comatose episode -- maybe a seizure or something else.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Doctors really don't know a great deal that
goes on with human bodies and of what they do know, most of it is guess work.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Here is an example of what drugs do: I took 150 valium, <span
class=GramE>50 beta blocker (<span class=SpellE>Obsidan</span>)</span>, some
French prescription sleeping pills, 12 <span class=SpellE>Sominex</span>, 10 <span
class=SpellE>Codein</span>, and a glass of light alcohol (20%) -- much alcohol
could cause me to throw up the pills. I planned to take the boric acid after
loosing sensitivity. However, I lost <span class=SpellE>consciouseness</span>
about 20 minutes past taking the pills while still outside of my apartment (I
went to put a letter to the mailbox), so I couldn't get to the acid (I expected
to have no less than 30 minutes). I never made it back to the apartment;
apparently I was able to move while being <span class=SpellE>uncouscious</span>.

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>…In hospital I was on the respirator, tubes, etc. and my
first understanding came about 5-6 days after I was found. I had 50 scull
fractures, contusion, bleeding from the ear, CSF leak, and, the worst, facial
paralysis on one side w/t eye closure/tearing. I don't have memory of 7 days
completely.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Doctors tried to commit me but I went out after the judge
hearing (I have no memory of it). I had to have the head surgery later to
repair the cranial nerve at brainstem -- the doctor said he don't understand
why I stayed alive after the head trauma.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I talked for several days with someone who had seen this
movie Final Exit. He explained to me a method which sounded very convincing, as
I had never considered overdosing from hearing all the horror stories. To me a
method of sleeping pills, a bag, and rubber bands was described. I went about
gathering all my necessary materials over the course of a few days and then
found my secluded location where I would not be found for at least a day or two
(more than enough time) I was instructed to take sleeping pills that I could
crush/slip powder into a drink, something that I could gulp down quickly. Also
I was recommended using a juice of some kind as the acidity would aid in the
speed of the process. I followed instructions, and this is where things went
wrong. I wasn't given a specific dose that I should take, so in purchasing one
package it wasn't enough. It resulted in a high of sorts, with hallucinations
and everything. I went home in this disoriented state unaware that I was under
any influence. Several hours later I was confronted, threatened to be taken to
a hospital, but instead put to bed (very lucky for me). I woke up the next
morning, with the inside skin of my mouth dead and peeling, and the worst
dawning of what I had just woken up to. The next week of my life is one that I
almost do not remember, and just the though of drinking orange juice literally
makes me gag. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>...My first attempt was at the age of 22. It was just about
entirely unplanned--at least consciously....We had gotten into a big fight the
night before.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I went shopping at the
mall the next day to get out of the house....As I was driving home, I was about
to pass a drug store and made a snap decision to go in and buy some sleeping
pills.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I know now, after spending a few
days on the internet trying to find something that DOES work, that this is not
usually a very successful method.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>At the
time, I suppose I figured if one or two sleeping pills could knock me out, a
whole bottle or two would do just fine.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I went home and
started writing out things that I wanted to take place after I died....Then I
started downing as many of the pills with water as I could as fast as I could
before I could lose my nerve, which the hospital estimated at between 80-100
pills.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I started to gag at some point,
but kept forcing them down.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It never
occurred to me, as some of these websites point <span class=GramE>out, that</span>
I should have checked into a hotel or ran off to <st1:country-region><st1:place>Mexico</st1:place></st1:country-region>
to do the deed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I'm sure part of me
wanted to be found or I would have done a better job, but I was also dumb to
the realities.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I remember my husband
trying to slap me awake, being carried down the steps, wetting myself in the
emergency room and the panic that set in the second before I conked out when I
realized that I was paralyzed and couldn't move and then being amazed that even
though everything else had shut down, my hearing was the last to go.<span

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I somewhat woke up
about a week later in the hospital to a nurse trying to get me sign transfer
papers.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>According to my husband and
family, I had talked to them and even made phone calls on my own during the
week, but did not remember a second of the week up to that point.<span

another hospital and even that second week is a bit foggy.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Apparently I said things to the doctors about
my past that were not even true and I don't know if this is because I was loopy
and didn't understand the questions, or they didn't understand my answers....</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>...One day I took a full box of a certain type of <span
class=SpellE>tricyclic</span> anti-depressants. I don't remember which ones <span
class=GramE>exactly,</span> as I had thrown away the box and kept them in a
different container together with the date of expiry....I collected several
more anti-depressants of various kinds. According to the book, it was enough
for a lethal dose, albeit only just.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>so</span> one day last December I figured
it was time, so I got really drunk on half a bottle of <span class=SpellE>wodka</span>.
I had a bit of quiche, hoping this would keep my stomach from throwing up, and
then I took those tablets.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I was lying on my couch, plastic covering on it in case I
threw up. I vaguely remember getting into bed. Needless to say, I woke up the
next day. <span class=GramE>In time to call in sick for work and family.</span><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The kitchen was a bit of a mess, broken glass
in the sink of which I had no recollection. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For the next 2 days I suffered from 'small brain damage' <span
class=SpellE>syndrom</span>, like it was really difficult to walk straight. I
slept for the best part of those 2 days, and even though I feared these
symptoms might be permanent (brain damage being the worst nightmare of a failed
suicide attempt!!!!), I didn't dare call any doctor for I was <span
class=SpellE>embarassed</span> what people would say if they found out.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I must say, it felt very empty afterwards. <span
class=GramE>it</span> was a serious attempt and having to go on with life as
though nothing had happened and no one knowing about it made me feel very empty
and lonely and desperate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The <span class=SpellE>symptons</span> have disappeared. Now
I find myself increasingly forgetful and suffering slightly from aphasia, but
that was already starting before the attempt. I figure that it is due either to
my chronic use of diazepam (5mg a day on average, doctor's prescription) or
drinking too much wine.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>destructive</span> thought patterns that
are associated with such....</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On [date] I attempted to kill myself by injecting</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1600 units of <span class=SpellE>Novolog</span>
(rapid-acting) insulin into 16 separate sites on</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>my</span> body.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(I used different sites because I'd read that
a bolus can be</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>excised</span> surgically if they find
your limp, twitching, or comatose body</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>in</span> time.)<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I used <span class=SpellE>Novolog</span>, or
rapid-acting insulin, because it was</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>what</span> I had on hand -- I'm a type-I
diabetic using an insulin pump. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For reference, my typical daily use is about 40 to 50 units
of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>insulin</span>, which is of course spread
out over a 24-hour period each day.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I gave myself the insulin at around <st1:time Minute="30"
Hour="10">10:30</st1:time> in the morning. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Rapid-acting <span class=SpellE>insulins</span> (such as <span
class=SpellE>Novolog</span> and <span class=SpellE>Humalog</span>) tend to peak
in</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>around</span> 2 hours, so I was
anticipating waking up dead (sorry, figure of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>speech</span>) before <st1:time Minute="0"
Hour="12">noon</st1:time>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I was hoping
that sheer amount of insulin would</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>be</span> enough to cause a hypoglycemic
coma and death fairly rapidly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I didn't use my pump to give it to myself, because I judged
it would</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>just</span> take much too long and be too
much trouble.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I pulled out all the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>insulin</span> syringes I had in the
house.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This happened to be 16 <span

stomach, one in my thigh, one in</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>the</span> back of my arm, one in my
hip.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I picked sites randomly; all the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>places</span> that a diabetic can use to
inject her insulin each day.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Only</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>the</span> first one was scary.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The next 15 were methodical; I didn't even</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>feel</span> like it was me doing it.<span

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>girl</span> give herself a huge overdose.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After injecting the insulin, I went to sleep.<span

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>as</span> I hadn't really been out of bed
in 2 days.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I was exhausted, and I</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>fell</span> asleep right away.<span

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>syringes</span> on my nightstand.<span

even qualified as such.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I wasn't</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>...I woke up a little after <st1:time Minute="0" Hour="12">12:00pm</st1:time>,
about 1.5 hours after giving myself</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>the</span> insulin, shaking, covered in
sweat, and having a very typical</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>hypoglycemic</span> episode.<span

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now I was scared.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>How
had 1600 units of rapid-acting insulin not</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>killed</span> me?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Fearing that I was going to end up
brain-damaged, rather</p>

up.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They let</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>themselves</span> in and assured

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>followed</span>.<span

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>I didn't care.<span

hours.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I'm not sure</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>that</span> the doctors believed me at

<p class=MsoNormal>I was actually in hospital...receiving treatment for severe
Schizophrenia and depression when I pocketed one razor from a 3 blade shaving
razor. The hacks didn't inspect that razor though they supervised my shaving. I
waited until late at night when the supervision would be least and nurses would
only check in periodically to see supposedly sleeping patients. I went into the
bathroom and started hacking at my wrists. I had heard debates on which would
be the right direction to cut so I decided to cut both ways. However I fainted
before I could finish cutting and woke up in the emergency room. They said <span

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>once</span>, a long time ago, <span
class=SpellE>i</span> attempted suicide twice. <span class=GramE>first</span>,
by placing a gun to my head &amp; pulling the trigger. <span class=GramE>the</span>
second time, by overdosing on drugs. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the gun failed to go off which was lucky for me as <span
class=SpellE>i</span> didn't know at the time that a .22 often times only
wrecks your brain but fails to kill you. <span class=SpellE><span class=GramE>i</span></span>
didn't have the courage to try it again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>the</span> drug overdose would likely have
done the job but <span class=SpellE>i</span> was stupid enough to try and
locate myself where <span class=SpellE>i</span> would be found by a friend and
crashed my car on the way while merely under the influence.. <span class=GramE>which</span>
caused me to end up in the hospital <span class=SpellE>er</span>....</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I took 17 [of the] 500mg <span class=SpellE>vicidan</span>
[sic---probably <span class=SpellE>vicodin</span>] pills. I got scared after I
took them and told my mom right away. She told me to try to throw them up but I
was to upset and my throat felt like it was swollen shut. My mom drove me to
the hospital and I packed some stuff because I knew they would keep me for
awhile to make sure I was mentally stable enough to go home. I got there and
they made me wait 10 minutes in the waiting room before they took me back and
asked me what I did. I felt really dizzy and tired. I wanted to just go to
sleep and then everything would be fine. They took down my insurance information
and then they brought me back to the Exam room. They made me drink 2 <span
class=SpellE>botles</span> of charcoal that stuff tastes like ground up chalk
watered down and died black. They did all these tests on me to make sure I was
ok and I guess I was so they <span class=SpellE>transfered</span> me to the
mental ward and I ended up never wanting to do that again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>...I went to the local library and looked up the medication
I was taking.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I noticed that like many
in its class, it was a CNS depressant and back then, the PDR helpfully listed
the lowest known lethal dose.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I did some
basic calculations and knew that I had more than the minimum needed to cause
death.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>I kept the medication
in my car, not the best storage place but it fit into my plan.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I didn't drink at all but knew that alcohol
is also a CNS depressant so purchased a pint of vodka... </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I kept my cache and scouted the area where I lived for a
likely spot.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I had strict rules about
killing myself.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I wouldn't do it so that
others would be likely to witness it, particularly children.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I wouldn't do it at home to spare my family
the memory/blame of my death.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I wouldn't
jump off a bridge because some Good Samaritan might risk, or even lose, his or
her life in an attempt to save mine.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I
figured it would be truly horrendous if someone else died trying to save me but
I lived.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I didn't want that guilt.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>I continued to work
but life became more and more of a burden until one night I just couldn't take
it anymore.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I got in my car and drove
off to an area where I knew I wouldn't be noticed quickly.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I had been calling a hotline and talking to a
counselor there, I told her all about my research and recall how shocked she
was to realize I enjoyed the intellectual pursuit of information.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I called her one last time that night, drank
the vodka, swallowed the pills, and drove off.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What I hadn't counted on was how quickly the medication and
alcohol would affect me.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My last memory
was that I needed to pull over because I was a hazard.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I would never endanger someone else but I
blacked out before I could pull over.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I
did manage to get the car off the road but the bumper was sticking out a bit
and that caused a passing cop to notice.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>He stopped to see if I were ill and when he got to the car, he thought I
was already dead.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This part of course is <span class=GramE>hearsay,</span> I
was in a coma for three days.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I woke up
in ICU with tubes everywhere.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My first
thought was one of annoyance at all the tubes.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I immediately pulled the one from my nose, not realizing it was threaded
into my stomach.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I retched but out it
came.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The IVs in my arms were another
story, my arms were tied with bandages to boards, and bending them was annoying
that's how I realized they had IVs in them.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>A nurse came over and spoke to me but I drifted in and out of awareness
for the next few days. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>When I finally was
able to engage in conversation my cousin who is a nurse told me that had the
paramedics arrived twenty minutes later they'd not have attempted to revive
me....</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, that's the unlovely story of my first and most serious
attempt.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I classify it that way because
subsequent attempts have not resulted in anywhere near the same recovery
time.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I think it is because medicine is
now better equipped to deal with such things, but I can't be sure.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What I am sure of is that I have never made a
'gesture,' I have always intended to die.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>

<p class=MsoNormal>I had just <span class=SpellE>just</span> enough <span
class=SpellE>Amebien</span> [sic: <span class=SpellE>Ambien</span>] (sleeping
pill) to put me to sleep.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So I took them, and place a plastic bag over my head, with a
strong</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>rubber-band</span> around the neck. I held
my fingers under the bag in such a way</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>so</span> that as I fell asleep, they
would slide out, and <span class=SpellE>exphixiate</span> me. I used</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>oil</span> on my fingers to insure this
purpose.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But the damn bag kept falling off as I &quot;slept&quot;. I
kept waking up with the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>damn</span> bag in the incorrect place.
Finally, I said &quot;enough of this shit&quot; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>called</span> 911. Being in the hospital
was worse than the suicide attempt IMHO.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I've attempted suicide several times...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The first was when I was 10 years old.... I overdosed on a
giant bottle of <span class=SpellE>Bayers</span> <span class=SpellE>apirin</span>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span class=GramE>The most recent [age 14]
last month.</span><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I slit my left
wrist.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It wasn't even that big of a cut,
it was small and not that deep, but it bled like a bitch.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There was a big pool of blood on my floor
from it pouring out of my body and onto the floor, it splattered off of that
and got on my shoes that I only had for a couple weeks at the time, which
pissed me off.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I <span class=SpellE>stopepd</span>
the bleeding eventually, and then I'd ever so lightly slide the razorblade over
it again, in doing so, it poured again... and again.. <span class=GramE>and</span>
again.. and then I heard a knock at my door, I couldn't stop the bleeding soon
enough so I just grabbed my stocking that I cut up long ago to wear as an <span
class=SpellE>armwarmer</span>, and put it over the bloody wrist and threw my
black <span class=SpellE>sleepingbag</span> over the miniature pool of blood...
I then answered the door, it was my mother, she thought I had been yelling for
her and she just wanted to tell me that she was out in the backyard on the
trampoline talking on the phone... she still was on the phone... I told her
that I wasn't and basically tried getting rid of her ASAP without her <span
class=SpellE>realising</span> that I was trying to do so... when she had just
turned around I pulled my arm back because I felt the blood dripping down my
hand and starting to drip from my fingertips... She noticed... she grabbed my
arm and it was so bloody her whole hand was covered and you could see the red
and the cut up stocking/tights thing was black... it was completely soaked.. so
I tried keeping her out of my room but it didn't work <span class=SpellE>cuz</span>
she stuck her damn fingers in the door thing so I couldn't close it even if I
slammed her fingers in there or not (I didn't try to of course).. she finally
got in my room after I gave up and she was yelling at me as she dragged me into
the bathroom and made me wash the blood off and she tried to force me to put
pressure on it to stop the bleeding but I didn't want to, I eventually heeded
her command and did it but she wouldn't let off so I ran down the stairs and
out the door, went up to the hammock and ditched my blood stopper, I then went
across the street to the lake to steal the boat and get away... I couldn't find
any keys, so I just sat there, about an hour or two later she showed up and
tried talking to me about it but I basically said fuck u after she pissed me
off and started yelling at me again, and I went back to the house, locked her
out, went to my room in search of my 2<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>razorblades I put under my CD case to hide them... they were gone, I was
really pissed so I locked myself in the bathroom and wouldn't let her in or go
out there to show her I wasn't cutting more.. <span class=GramE>but</span> the
whole time I was arguing that I hadn't cut anymore upon entering the bathroom,
I was busting another shaving razor to cut.. <span class=GramE>and</span> I
did, a little... eventually I left the bathroom and went to sleep, it drains <st1:City><st1:place><span
  class=SpellE>ur</span></st1:place></st1:City> energy and makes u tired...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Here's a first-hand account of an attempt with acetaminophen
combined</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>with</span> <span class=SpellE>diphenhydramine</span>.
This was intended to be lethal, rather than a</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>gesture</span>, although I was slightly
ambivalent....</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I was 22 years old at the time. I am female, and I weighed
about 140</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>pounds</span> at the time of the overdose.
I had researched acetaminophen as a</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>suicide</span> method, and mistakenly
thought that liver failure happens</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>quickly</span> (I now know otherwise). I
took extra strength Tylenol, which was</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>500 mg per pill.</span> I took somewhere
between 25 and 35 pills.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I also took <span class=SpellE>diphenhydramine</span>,
because I mistakenly assumed it would make</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>me</span> sleep through any unpleasant
effects from the overdose. I am not sure</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>how</span> many of those I took, but it
was probably around 30-40 pills. I do</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>not</span> know what the <span
class=SpellE>miligrams</span> were per pill; I only know that they were</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>marketed</span> as an over-the-counter
sleeping pill. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After taking all the pills, I decided I should take my dog
for a walk</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>before</span> things got serious. At some
point during the walk, the pills</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>started</span> having an effect. My
ability to hear changed: everything sounded</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>faraway</span> and tinny. When I talked to
my dog, I could barely hear my own</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>voice</span>. I could hear, however, that
I was slurring words terribly...I felt very dizzy, and I could not walk in a
straight line. I began sweating profusely, even though it was</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>quite</span> chilly out. By the time I was
almost back to my apartment, I had</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>no</span> coordination and could barely
lead my dog back into my apartment. I</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>remember</span> walking by a girl on the
sidewalk, and she stepped aside and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>looked</span> at me like I was insane. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Once I got back inside, the sensation of a wave came over
me, and I</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>began</span> violently dry heaving, just
bringing up some bile, with no pill</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>fragments</span>. As luck would have it, I
am <span class=SpellE>emetophobic</span> (absolutely terrified</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>of</span> vomiting, an actual phobia,
believe it or not). For this reason, I</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>panicked</span> and called 911. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When the paramedics came, I was barely able to stand up. It
felt like</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>only</span> a short time had passed since
I took the pills, but it had actually</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>been</span> about 3 hours, so I must have
been out with my dog much longer than</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I realized. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the emergency room, they gave me activated charcoal,
which I kept</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>vomiting</span> up. I never actually felt
nausea; it was just a wave sensation,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>followed</span> by unexpected puking. They
ended up putting a tube into my nose</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>and</span> down my throat, in the hopes
that administering charcoal that way</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>would</span> keep it down. They were
wrong, and I puked some more. I also kept</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>falling</span> asleep with my eyes open,
sitting up. My best friend had come to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>sit</span> with me in the ER, and she
described it as my eyes glazing over and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>my</span> mouth hanging slack-jawed. She'd
laugh at this sight, which would</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>wake</span> me up. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They drew blood. The doctor (who, oddly enough, looked
exactly like</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kevin Spacey) came to me and said, &quot;Unfortunately, too
much Tylenol got</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>into</span> your blood stream. We have to
give you something that smells like</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>rotten</span> eggs called <span
class=SpellE>Mucomyst</span>. You took a fatal amount of Tylenol, and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>liver</span> failure is not a fun way to
die. The <span class=SpellE>Mucomyst</span> will counteract the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tylenol you took.&quot; He did not tell me exactly how much
Tylenol was in my</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>blood</span>; he just told me it was a
fatal amount if I didn't have the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>antidote</span>. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The antidote really did smell like rotten eggs, so they
combined it with</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>apple</span> juice to make it more
palatable. I had to drink a cup of it every</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4 hours for a few days. During this time, I was constantly
having</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>diarrhea</span>, which looked exactly like
activated charcoal. I was also kept</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>on</span> an IV to give me fluids. The
diarrhea and vomiting screwed up my</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>potassium</span>, so I had to take giant
potassium pills. I was not allowed to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>eat</span> for 24 hours after the
overdose, because they were not yet sure if</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>my</span> liver had escaped unharmed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>My medical hospitalization for the overdose lasted 3 days.
Then, I was</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>sent</span> to the psychiatric unit for 9
more days. I did not suffer any</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>long-term</span> effects from this
overdose, and my liver is healthy. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I strongly advise against Tylenol <span class=SpellE>overdosage</span>,
because even though I got</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>off</span> easy, I still suffered a lot
and felt very sick for the first couple</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>of</span> days. The way I felt for the
first day is absolutely the worst</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>physical</span> feelings I've ever had.
The only good thing to come of it was</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>an</span> odd feeling of catharsis at
having actually tested my own mortality,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>and</span> an odd feeling of satisfaction
at having taken what would have been</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>a</span> lethal overdose had I not
received the antidote. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I wanted to tell you about a recent suicide attempt I made.
I took 13,000 mg</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>of</span> <span class=SpellE>Seroquel</span>
(an anti-psychotic). About 15 minutes after I ingested the pills</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>I began to tingle all
over my body and grew very cold. I then passed out.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Help was sent quite quickly. I lost consciousness before
help arrived and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>only</span> know what I've been told and
read. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the ER, I had almost no gag reflex, so they <span
class=SpellE>intubated</span> me. I was in the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ICU, <span class=SpellE>intubated</span>, and in a coma for
three days (the half life of the drug was</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>how</span> long I would be in a coma).
During my coma, I would move and try to rip</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>out</span> the tubs so I was restrained.
All in all, it wasn't effective. Obviously</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>However, if I had
been in an isolated place, I wonder if it would have been</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>effective</span>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I've tried taking all kinds of pills before which have only
ended me up in the hospital (either someone finds me or if <span class=SpellE>i</span>
swallow them all at once <span class=SpellE>i</span> end up throwing up); <span
class=SpellE>i've</span> tried to <span class=SpellE>electricute</span> myself in
the bathtub (like on groundhog day) using a hair dryer and a toaster but they
both were grounded and didn't do shit; <span class=SpellE>i've</span> tried
putting a tight plastic bag over my face but every time <span class=SpellE>i</span>
panic when I can't breathe and end up ripping it off; it's the same with trying
to hang myself outside my door - <span class=SpellE>i</span> can't force myself
to stay there (plus all the weird sounds coming out of my mouth freak the shit
out of me). I realized suspension hanging would be the best option in my
situation (<span class=SpellE>i</span> live in a small town, and don't drive)
but when I tried it the rope snapped. This time <span class=SpellE>i</span> am
going to buy the strongest rope I can find and give it another go around.<span

<p class=MsoNormal>I am a 15 year old female. I went through a depression and

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>to</span> cut my wrists. I got the knife,

didn't use enough pressure and my wrists bled and it hurt. I </p>

took a bunch of random pills which left me with </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>cut</span> up wrists and a massive <span

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=SpellE><span class=GramE>i</span></span> did my
first suicide <span class=SpellE>attemps</span>... nothing much, it was a cry
for help... a few sleeping pills (non prescription ones) and a few slashes on
my <span class=SpellE>wrists..<span class=GramE>i</span></span> threw them up
and . <span class=SpellE><span class=GramE>i</span></span> called ER.. <span
class=SpellE><span class=GramE>i</span></span> spent the night there, hoping <span
class=SpellE>i'd</span> be <span class=SpellE>hospitalised</span> in
psychiatry, but no, <span class=SpellE>i</span> was sent back the next morning
with no help....... WHAT A MISTAKE. The year was absolute HELL. I was shut up
in a flat, just throwing up all <span class=SpellE>i</span> could, fattening up
(bulimia makes you fat), hesitating of throwing myself off the window or not...
all alone, <span class=SpellE>i</span> mean, just hell... no <span
class=SpellE>tv</span>, no telephone, nothing....... just sitting in the room,
ALL DAY
LONG.................................................god.........................<span
class=GramE>;horrible</span>................hell....................................;
it just built up a year of agony in me, which will explain my further suicide <span
class=SpellE>attemps</span> later....</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The 25 of November, a Sunday, <span class=SpellE>i</span>
come back to my empty flat. I knew it... it's the time.... <span class=SpellE>i'd</span>
<span class=SpellE>taked</span> all the strong medication at home, and a cord
to hang myself... <span class=SpellE>i'd</span> had a fight with my brother,
and like usual my mum had taken his defense... <span class=SpellE>i'd</span> warned
them.... <span class=SpellE>i'd</span> even warned the shrink a week earlier <span
class=SpellE>i'd</span> do it... <span class=SpellE>i</span> was in tears... <span
class=SpellE>i</span> just couldn't take life anymore.. 5 fucking years of
bulimia <span class=SpellE>i'd</span> done EVERYTHING on earth to get out of
it, EVERYTHGIN... therapy, <span class=SpellE>hospitalisation</span>,
shrinks... all... still there..... <span class=GramE>So anyway....</span> I
took all my medication... all full boxes... 4 <span class=SpellE>boses</span>
of <span class=SpellE>effexor</span> 50, two boxes of <span class=SpellE>atarax</span>,
2boxes of <span class=SpellE>xanax</span> and one box of <span class=SpellE>seropram</span>.......
thinking about a year ago <span class=SpellE>i'd</span> thrown away my <span
class=SpellE>ahtymil</span>... <span class=SpellE>i</span> would had died
hadn't <span class=SpellE>i</span>.......... <span class=SpellE>i</span> also
hung up the cord to hang myself when <span class=SpellE>i'd</span> be groggy
enough..... <span class=SpellE>i</span> put on <span class=SpellE>romeo</span>
and <span class=SpellE>juliet</span> on <span class=SpellE>tv</span>, and just
relaxed......... an hour later <span class=SpellE>i</span> just collapsed on
the floor........; everything seemed <span class=SpellE>blury</span>... <span
class=SpellE>i</span> tried to get up but <span class=SpellE>i</span>
couldn't... and <span class=SpellE>i</span> laughed interiorly.. and thought
&quot;this is the end baby <span class=SpellE>hahahaha</span>&quot;... and <span
class=SpellE>i</span> dragged myself to the bathroom to look for my <span
class=SpellE>rasorblades</span> to cut my wrists... <span class=SpellE>i</span>
couldn't find them <span class=SpellE>i</span> was just too spaced out ... so <span
class=SpellE>i</span> went back to where the cord was awaiting me and <span
class=SpellE>i</span> tried to get up, to hand myself, because <span
class=SpellE>i</span> <span class=GramE>REALLY<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>wanted</span> to die... for me there was NO question <span class=SpellE>i</span>
would survive.. <span class=GramE>but</span> <span class=SpellE>i</span>
couldn't stand up..... <span class=GramE>so</span> all night <span
class=SpellE>i</span> just dragged myself on the floor, semi unconscious,
waiting for my death. At one point <span class=SpellE>i</span> got <span
class=GramE>REALLY<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>thirsty</span> , so <span
class=SpellE>i</span> tried with my mug on the floor (<span class=SpellE>i'm</span>
really untidy) to drink water from the toilet, as <span class=SpellE>i</span>
couldn't even get up to the sink... but even that <span class=SpellE>i</span>
didn't have the <span class=SpellE>strenth</span>... so <span class=SpellE>i</span>
turned on the shower and drank there... <span class=SpellE>i</span> was soaking
wet... anyway the lady from the…school, the next day, worried not seeing me..
so she called the lady that <span class=SpellE>taked</span> care of my flat
unit , that said she didn't see me get out today... so they called the
firemen... and <span class=SpellE>i</span> heard them knock in the morning, and
<span class=SpellE>i</span> was like &quot;shit&quot; but <span class=SpellE>i</span>
thought (totally knocked out&quot; they'd leave me alone... and about half an
hour later <span class=SpellE>i</span> saw them emerge from my balcony...I had
hidden the boxes of my <span class=SpellE>medecine</span>, to not have the
chance to get an antidote, but being so spaced out <span class=SpellE>i</span>
told them where <span class=SpellE>i</span> had hidden them (but anyway there
was no antidote)......... next thing <span class=SpellE>i</span> knew <span
class=SpellE>i</span> was in ER with my crying brother over me saying &quot;why
did you do that&quot;......&quot;you're not even fat&quot;....... yes but <span
class=SpellE>i'm</span> sick..... <span class=SpellE>i've</span> had a hell of
a time.......... all <span class=SpellE>i</span> answered is &quot;<span
class=SpellE>i'll</span> do it again, and again, and again, until <span
class=SpellE>i'll</span> succeed&quot;......</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The next day, <span class=SpellE>i</span> was sore all over,
like bruises all over... and my bladder was blocked... so <span class=SpellE>i</span>
had to have a urinary thing stuck up my bladder... they said it was because of
the massive dose of <span class=SpellE>anxiolytics</span>...it lasted for about
6 days........</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Anyway... there <span class=SpellE>i</span> stayed for a
couple of weeks, before <span class=SpellE>i</span> had a fight with the
shrink... <span class=SpellE>i</span> tried to strangle myself with a cord
(once <span class=SpellE>i've</span> made a decision, the decision is made, and
<span class=SpellE>i'd</span> made the decision to die)...and <span
class=SpellE>i</span> broke a <span class=SpellE>miror</span> to mutilate
myself.......; so <span class=SpellE>i</span> was put in &quot;isolation
room&quot;.. you know where the bed is ceiled to the floor, the toilets have no
bowl, and you have to know like a maniac to call the nurses because there is no
bell... yes prison...... <span class=SpellE>i</span> stayed in there about 5
days......</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After a bit more time <span class=SpellE>i</span> was
allowed out a bit, to visit my parents... so <span class=SpellE>i</span> went
home...... <span class=SpellE>i</span> had a prescription close to about 400
dollars of pills... <span class=SpellE>effexor</span> 50, massive doses, <span
class=SpellE>zyprexa</span>, <span class=SpellE>risperdal</span>, <span
class=SpellE>trileptal</span>.. <span class=GramE>and</span> all sorts of
groggy stuff....... even though it's the most disgusting thing to swallow huge <span
class=SpellE>quantites</span> of pills, <span class=SpellE>i</span> swallowed
it all....... and <span class=SpellE>i</span> cut my legs, trying to get the
femoral vein..... <span class=GramE>and</span> <span class=SpellE>i</span>
spilt ether all over my pillow (great mistake!)........ with my pea brain <span
class=SpellE>i</span> didn't think my mum would SMELL the ether, and so she
did, and <span class=SpellE>i</span> was rushed to ER where <span class=SpellE>i</span>
had my stomach pumped.....</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I was put back into isolation room (the shrink was cross!)
for a good <span class=GramE>week !!</span> and for all <span class=SpellE>i</span>
stayed 4 months in the <span class=SpellE>psychoward</span>......; with heroin
addicts, schizophrenics... when me....... <span class=SpellE>i</span> am <span
class=SpellE>bulemic</span>, and very <span class=SpellE>very</span>
depressed....... and just so damn sick of living.......</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>have</span> worked. Recently I overdosed

I didn't have more than maybe 20mg</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>of</span> Ativan and 10mg of <span

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=SpellE><span class=GramE>rmember</span></span> a
thing. I <span class=SpellE>aparently</span> was completely confused and <span
class=SpellE>trieed</span> to rip</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>out</span> the IV and get away. I then
escaped multiple forms of restraints. I</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>filled</span> out some <span class=SpellE>questionaire</span>
and apparently put down some strange</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>things</span>. Anyway, I was in a wheel

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>straight</span>, then I didn't really

<p class=MsoNormal>1.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I attempted
suicide I guess about 5 years ago by taking an overdose of <span class=SpellE>Midrin</span>,
which contains <span class=SpellE>aceitomenophen</span> (pardon the spelling)
as well as some sort of sedative.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I took

<p class=MsoNormal>2.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In another
attempt, just over 3 years ago, I overdosed on Ativan.<span

of 30 pills taken 2 at a time, 15 minutes apart, with minimal liquid to
discourage nausea.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Surprisingly, as far

had been pumped - I don't know.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I had
taken the drug in whole pill form rather than crushing it, and it acted more

forgot to take into account the effect of the drug itself.<span

</span>Apparently, however, even after 10 or 15 mgs of Ativan, it is possible
to become a real chatty <span class=SpellE><span class=GramE>cathy</span></span>

<p class=MsoNormal>I took only 18 aspirin before I stopped myself--I don't know
why. I then sat in my room, huddled up in a fetal position and rocking back and
forth, calmly repeating (to myself? <span class=GramE>To no one?)</span>
&quot;I am going to kill myself. I am going to die. I am going to kill myself.
I am going to die.&quot; <span class=GramE>Over and over.</span> <span
class=GramE>A mantra.</span> I waited that way for an hour or so, then became
convinced that the aspirin, a blood thinner, had probably kicked in. So I made
the cuts, as deep as I could, and gritted my teeth, telling myself it would be
the last pain. Then it would all be okay, just this last pain. I made cuts
parallel with the bottom of my hand at first, <span class=GramE>then</span>
perpendicular cuts, trying my best to slice open the vein. With profusely
bleeding wrists I went to the bathroom and turned on the shower to as hot as I
could stand it. I got in with all my clothes on, something I always considered
to be the action of someone who has no more hope and simply doesn't care. I
didn't care. My baggy denim pants soon became too heavy for me to stand in, and
I was getting dizzy, so I plugged the drain and lay down. The water was an
interesting shade of rust <span class=SpellE>colour</span>, and under it I
already looked dead. I stared at my seemingly lifeless limbs for a long time--I
don't know the <span class=SpellE>exaxct</span> amount. It seemed as though my
hands and legs and arms were no longer part of me; they simply existed. It was
as though they had already died, waiting for the rest of me to catch up. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I was so very exhausted. My eyes were heavy and it was a
struggle to keep up with the movements of the world around me, so I just let
them drop.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I assume I slid down farther into the water, though I don't
know how long I was inhaling it before I started coughing it all up and
regained <span class=SpellE>conciousness</span>. My wrists were barely still
bleeding. The water had turned lukewarm. I brought my wrists up out of the
water (they still looked dead) and observed how little they bled. I laughed; it
struck me as incredibly ironic at the time. Everything after that is a bit of a
haze; I remember bandaging my wrists in a robotic, automatic way, and viewing
my actions as though I were simply an observer...this couldn't, of course, be
me. Afterwards I fell asleep.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I thought you would <span class=GramE>interested</span> in
hearing about my attempt with codeine.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Hopefully, it will also spare a few people the discomfort of trying this
method without at least some modifications.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I obtained 40 regular codeine pills on two occasions.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Each contained slightly <span class=GramE>under</span>
30 mg of codeine with no Tylenol added.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>In total, it amounted to about 1100 mg of codeine per attempt.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The first time, I took several capsules of Benadryl and all
40 pills.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Falling asleep was a rather
pleasant experience, though I think I hallucinated a bit and I shivered
violently part of the time.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(These may
have been the &quot;seizures&quot; they warn about with codeine use, but they
were not painful at all.)<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I put a
plastic bag over my head and kept my hand on it, hoping that my hand would
relax and the bag would tighten once I fell asleep.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I never completely lost consciousness, though,
and every time my hand relaxed, I woke up from discomfort of suffocation.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I slept for 30 hours, waking up in the middle
to throw up, and felt woozy for the rest of the week.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The second time, I took several capsules of Benadryl,
Dramamine, and washed it down with a few shots of 80 proof liquor.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I could not handle more alcohol.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I cannot remember how many pills I took.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was close to but not the entire 40
pills.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I slept for even longer this time
and when I woke up, I felt so nauseous that I could not get out of bed for
several days.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Dramamine prevented me
from throwing up the codeine this time, and that coupled with the alcohol left
me in an extremely bad state.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The nausea
was incredibly uncomfortable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I would not recommend this method to anyone.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It might possibly work with a far greater
amount of codeine, but the LD50 usually given for humans (800 mg) does not seem
even close to the amount I think it would take to be effective.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I am a 115 pound, non-tolerant female who has
never used any kind of drugs or alcohol before in her life, and 1100 mg didn't
do a thing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>…you probably already have enough of aspirin overdoses, but
just in case.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I took 68 </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>aspirin</span> (was planning on taking 70,

taken about 20 the over coating had begun </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>to</span> wear off and it left a
disgusting acidy, almost vomit flavor in my mouth, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>so</span> I started taking them by the
hand full. It took me about 15 minutes </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>probably</span> to get them all down, and
a 12 oz bottle of water. After I finished </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I wandered around the house and actually felt normal, for
about 10 minutes </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>maybe</span>, then I began to feel
extremely shaky and twitchy.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I sat down
at the </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>kitchen</span> table and tapped my foot,
my ears started to ring, but it was </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>unnoticeable</span> when it started, I
really didn't realize they were ringing until </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I started going over myself to see how I was feeling.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I tried to check my </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>pulse</span>, but I was too shaky. Things
then began to feel as if they were slowing </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>down</span>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>At that point I changed my mind, (I know, <span

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>you</span> want to mess with, God's

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>went</span> upstairs and told my mum that
I'd taken the aspirin.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She took me into </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>the</span> bathroom and had me throw up
(I've got an eating disorder too, which she </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>knows</span> about so it made sense for
her to have me throw them up rather than </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>make</span> me go back to the hospital...)
I threw up probably between one-fourth </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>and</span> one half of the aspirin.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She then sent me to bed and, exhausted, I
fell </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>right</span> to sleep.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The next morning (about 3 hours later) my
ears were ringing </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>so</span> bad that I couldn't hear unless
someone yelled.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I fell over when I tried
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>to</span> stand and as soon as I woke up
ran straight to the bathroom and threw up </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>probably</span> the rest of the
aspirin.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I then drank 4 bottles of water
and threw </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>that up too, which was quite disgusting because it tasted
extremely acidly </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>and</span>...<span class=GramE>almost</span>
sour, coming back up. I was tipsy for the rest of the day and </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>slept</span> for most of it, which was
odd, b/c I'm usually an insomniac.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I intended to die from an overdose of blood pressure</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>pills(</span><span class=SpellE>clonodine</span>
[sic: <span class=SpellE>clonidine</span>] to be exact at a .3 mg dosage.). I

unaware of whether or not it would do the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>job(</span>I'm sure it would have.) I took
differ ant dosages at separate times</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I think it was perhaps around a 6 day difference max. The
first was</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>approx. 3.5 tablets at the dosage stated above, it caused a
sharp</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>decrease</span> in blood pressure(for
someone w/out hypertension.) results of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>this</span> included a black out while
conversing on the phone. I'm unaware of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>how</span> long it lasted.(several minutes
perhaps.) I was also unable to walk</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>or</span> to move very much for that
matter. I could crawl though<span class=GramE>.(</span>About the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>only</span> thing I could do actually.) As
for my second use of the medication</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>in</span> another what I will refer to as
an &quot;attempt&quot; due to the fact that it</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>failed</span>. It was approx 5-5.5 pills
that time<span class=GramE>.(</span>5 if I remember correctly.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I was on my way to school and I started to notice its <span
class=GramE>effects(</span>I was not</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>driving</span>.) I went on w/ the normal
school day and I was removed from my</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>first</span> class. I had left a
&quot;note&quot; and I didn't think to change a setting</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>on</span> my computer, which resulted in
the discovery of it so that I was</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;<span class=GramE>rescued</span>&quot; before it could
all take effect. I did my research to some</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>extent</span>, I had learned enough from
my previous attempt to know it would</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>take</span> effect in approx 1.5 pills at
a time. I was then taken to the ER and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>then</span> to a local psych. ward for a
stay of 6 days. Oh yes, the ER people</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>forced</span> me to drink
&quot;charcoal&quot; I'm sure your familiar w/ it. I think that</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>pretty</span> much sums it up.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Another overdose exists as well but that was w/ an
antidepressant and a mood stabilizer<span class=GramE>.(</span><span
class=SpellE>clorkon</span> and <span class=SpellE>depakote</span>.) Why I did
that I don't know, over 3,000MG's of <span class=SpellE>Depakote</span> and I think
maybe 100-150 Mg's of <span class=SpellE>Clorkon</span>.) Caused an intense
unpleasantness in the lungs as if someone had put a hole in them and then had
gone set a freezing cold fan in front of them<span class=GramE>.(</span>Overall
it was an extremely cold feeling in the lungs as if a hole were there.) </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Unfortunately I fell asleep before I could get the bag on
the first </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>time</span>. I woke up in a pool of vomit
(I took OTC sleeping pills, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>nowhere</span> near a lethal dose.) I was
a bit shaken and sleeping pills </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>cause</span> you to hallucinate (I found

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>ago</span>.) I continued throughout the

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>head</span> but I found that one begins to
panic when <span class=SpellE>unconciousness</span> starts </p>

to remove the bag from my head </p>

doorknob. After so many attempts I </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>was</span> weak and tired. I took some
time to regain my composure. When </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I went back to my apartment I suspended myself again but
this time </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>the</span> trauma of the failed attempts
hindered me. After about five </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>seconds</span> I knew that I had between
three and ten seconds to change my </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>mind</span> and I panicked again. I did
not have my hands bound so I </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>pulled</span> the rope from over the door
as I was losing <span class=SpellE>conciousness</span>. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When I came to on my bedroom floor I was delirious. I
started </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>kicking</span> and flailing around. When I
tried to get up and walk away </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>the</span> rope reminded me what was going
on. I took it off and that </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>would</span> be the last time I made an
attempt. I was too shaken and </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>traumatized</span> (for lack of a better
word) to try again. The will to </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>die</span> had faded.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Method: alcohol and <span class=SpellE>xanax</span> in small
overdose to relax and overcome anxiety while carrying out attempt - I was
hopeful that I'd simply pass out once underway - then cuts to both wrists (both
succeeding in severing/puncturing an artery) in a bath of warm water. At some
point I woke up in a cold bath of congealed black blood (It annoys me that they
always get this wrong in films: a <span class=SpellE>bathful</span> of blood
isn't pink, it isn't red, you can't see clouds or tendrils of blood flowing
into the water and uncurling artistically - it is BLACK, and slippery, and
thick with clots.) Not dead - not expected, to have to deal with this.
Fortunately still rather detached from the frightening or painful aspects of
the situation at this point, I managed to get out of the bath, and swallowed the
rest of the <span class=SpellE>xanax</span> (about 30, 1mg), and a leftover
vial of animal <span class=SpellE>tranquiliser</span> I had from flying my dog
overseas.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I had put out several bowls of
food for the dog, as well as water bowls, including a large, deep soup pot. I
was unable to get back into the bath, and so re-cut my wrists until I saw the
'spurt' indicating I'd hit correctly, and put them under water in the soup pot
to facilitate the bleeding. I did this on a Friday, when I wouldn't be expected
to meet or contact anyone until work on <span class=SpellE><span class=GramE>MOnday</span></span>
morning; I not only unplugged the prior to beginning, but took it apart and hid
the pieces from myself on two different high shelves; I locked, chained, and
shoved a chair under the knob of the door. I was found late Monday afternoon
(fire/policemen broke the door down, after being alerted by a <span
class=SpellE>neighbour</span>) and taken to hospital. It was estimated that I
had lost 2/3 of my blood volume; my hemoglobin count went below 4; treatment
included <span class=GramE>iv</span> fluids and blood transfusion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Survival of this attempt did not make me 'glad to be alive';
it has not been my last suicidal <span class=SpellE>behaviour</span>. Although
good things have happened since, as well as bad, I remain neutral about it: I
lived, that is what happened, ergo it can only be evaluated on that basis, not
in the 'but would it be better to have died?' sense - I suppose that the
extension of this thought is that life, and whether to stay alive, is a choice
that must be remade over and over until death, by whatever means, deliberate or
not.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Anyway, I had some utility razors (the snap-off kind) and
I'd skipped out of school. I made my way a hundred yards or so away to a
slightly wooded area and slashed away. The areas cut included the left side of
my left wrist (twice) the inside of my left arm (once) and my inside right
elbow (once). Blood flow was decent from the first three cuts, but I wanted
more so I went for the elbow. This bled freely and powerfully, though obviously
not powerfully or freely enough. The blood was streaming continuously down my
arm, off of my fingers and to the ground for several hours. Eventually, I went
into shock and became nauseous and disoriented. I found myself crawling around
the school grounds, dry-heaving collapsing. Soon enough I collapsed for the
last time and I could no longer move. Unfortunately, someone was nearby and saw
me. Needless to say, I ended up in the psych ward. According to the doctor,
however, I did at least manage to lose around nine of sixteen pints of blood in
my body and had to be given transfusions and kept in intensive care. I wish I
could have just kept my ass in one place for a little while longer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The first attempt was made at work - somewhere where I knew
people were nearby to intervene. I cut my wrist with my keys. I was absolutely
terrified, alone, and had given up on life. I went in to take a shower to wash
off the blood, only to make more cuts with a razor blade. I paged my
psychologist and had a friend take me to the ER. The cuts were fairly
superficial and there was definitely a great deal of ambivalence about my
decision. I was admitted to the psychiatric ICU and was locked up in my own
room. I was absolutely hysterical. I looked for anything and everything to cut
my</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>wrist</span> with - the jagged edge of a <span
class=SpellE>kleenex</span> box, a plastic knife, the unraveled end of a
toothpaste tube. I was still suicidal when I left the hospital seven days
later. I did &quot;ok&quot; for a couple months before I really started sinking
again. I was cutting my wrist on a daily basis. I think this went on for a week
before my family found out and took me to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>the</span> hospital. This time the cuts
were a little bit deeper, and there was a little less ambivalence than the
first incident. I was there for five days. I pretended that things were back to
normal so that I could get the hell out of there. Things were ok again for a
few months, <span class=GramE>then</span> I started doing it again. If I was
upset, I cut my wrist. This time I was</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>serious</span> about doing it. Several
times, the bleeding wouldn't stop and would soak through a huge <span
class=SpellE>bandaid</span>. I started overdosing on <span class=SpellE>asprin</span>
before I cut my wrist, thinking that just maybe I would bleed a little easier and
it would go faster. This went on for over a week before I went into the <span
class=SpellE>hosital</span> again. I landed in the ER after overdosing on <span
class=SpellE>Compazine</span> (an <span class=SpellE>antiemetic</span>), a
handful of Advil, a handful of <span class=SpellE>Neurontin</span> (an</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>anticonvulsant</span>), and several <span
class=SpellE>asprin</span>. I had also made a large cut in my wrist. I was
drifting in and out of consciousness on the way to the hospital, and had a
great experience having my stomach pumped. My heart rate was irregular. That
was the first time I could have really DIED. I was only in the hospital for
three days, and left AMA. I wanted to go home. That was in July. I started
again in September and almost went</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>into</span> the hospital again (and
probably should have). I cut my wrists for two weeks, <span class=GramE>then</span>
stopped. My boyfriend/<span class=SpellE>fiance</span> told me that he would
leave me if it happened again (this was after the third hospitalization). I decided
that it wasn't worth it. If I wasn't going to do it all the way, I wasn't going
to do it at all. I don't know what the future will be</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>like</span>. It seems like every time
something stressful comes up, I start cutting my wrist or overdosing on
medication. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>My (unsuccessful, of course) method of trying to kill
myself, about</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>eight</span> and a half years ago, was to
ingest one full bottle of sleeping</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>pills</span> and a quart of gin. I walked
to the park--I had been up all</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>night</span>--and passed out on a bench. I
have a vague memory of talking to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>someone's</span> dog, also of heckling
somebody. (Hard to believe I could</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>remember</span> anything, but I drank
quite a lot at that time, a fact partly</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>responsible</span> for my lousy state of
mind.) I don't know what happened,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>someone</span> must have made some kind of
a call; I remember throwing up, it</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>was</span> black stuff, into a toilet in a
little room made of gray blocks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Someone must have been holding me by my upper arms as I did
so, because</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>they</span> were bruised later.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>I woke up among
more gray blocks, in what must have been another</p>

out sometime in the afternoon. I</p>

summertime.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I am 15 <span class=SpellE>i</span> have tried to kill me
self numerous times my first attempt was because I was &quot;in love&quot; and
wasn't loved in return. <span class=GramE>so</span> I wrote out my will at that
time everything went to friends and I slit my wrist I being a brilliant child
didn't do it the right way, Attempt</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>one</span> failed. After learning from
older kids I decided to try again this time because me and my best friends
weren't friends anymore me and <span class=SpellE>lorna</span> have been friends
since second grade, yes we are friends again any way <span class=SpellE>i</span>
tried my wrist again and <span class=SpellE>i</span> did it the right way and
it hurts like hell they rush you to the hospital and literally piece your veins
back together then they tie you the bed so you don't try it again and then you
get 6 months of out patient counseling and you are let with really bad scare I
have them on both wrist going both ways across and down.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Later I enter seventh grade and <span
class=SpellE>i</span> find</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>myself</span> with the &quot;wrong
crowd&quot; the kids how think of nothing more than getting</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>high</span> and drunk. <span class=GramE>and</span>
boy when you quite hanging out with them you catch hell!!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>so</span> <span class=SpellE>i</span>
decided dying was my one way at finding peace<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>so this time <span class=SpellE>i</span> took my</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mom and <span class=GramE>dads</span> pill (mom's mood swing

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>shots</span> of vodka and <span
class=SpellE>i</span> again find myself in the hospital with a tube shoved</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>down</span> my throat and tie to a bed and
another 6 months of counseling well <span class=SpellE>i</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>think</span> <span class=SpellE>i</span>
have gotten better now <span class=SpellE>i</span> still think about it ever

<p class=MsoNormal>….I took one of the needles from the syringe for no reason.
Just to have one around. One night, when I was feeling particularly depressed
because my aunt had died of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>cancer</span> the month before, I decided
I didn't want to be sad any more and found</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>the</span> needle. I took it and decided
to slit my left wrist. I heard you bleed</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>faster</span> if you cut it <span
class=SpellE>verticlly</span>. So I did. Well, I just ended up scraping my</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>skin</span> away until I reached a vein.
It was so painful. Well, I reached a large</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>vein</span> and started to bleed
uncontrollably. Just then my best friend called</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>just</span> to tell me she missed seeing
me and wanted to come over. I told her it</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>wasn't</span> a good idea but she came
anyway. <span class=GramE>when</span> she arrived and found me half</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>alive</span> on my kitchen floor. She
called the paramedics and they rushed me to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>the</span> hospital. I will always be
grateful for her coming over. Now I have a</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>huge</span>, ugly scar on my left wrist
right along my vein. I have to look at it</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>every</span> day. It always reminds me how
nice it is to be alive. When others ask</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>what</span> happened, I tell them it's a
burn. I just can't bring myself to say &quot;I</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>tried</span> to kill myself.&quot; It will
be there for the rest of my life. I just don't</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>believe</span> it ever happened.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I took an overdose of <span class=SpellE>Panadeine</span> (<span
class=SpellE>paracetamol</span> and <span class=SpellE>codiene</span>),</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>48 tablets in all, well over the LD50 for
someone of my size.</span> Washed</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>down</span> with a bottle of port. This
took about 10 minutes. I felt drunk</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>first</span>, then about 20 <span
class=SpellE>mins</span> later I began feeling a horrible sense of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>panic</span>. I was shaky, <span
class=SpellE>alternatley</span> hot and cold, sweating and turned red.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I felt like I couldn't breathe, and swigged water as I
stumbled around</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>the</span> pavement. Eventually someone
noticed my sorry state and called an</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>ambulance</span>. I was talking in the
ambulance, but lost <span class=SpellE>conciousness</span> on the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>way</span> to hospital.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I woke up again and began vomiting (which probably saved my
life). I was</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>covered</span> in tubes and monitors, and
made to drink charcoal. When I passed</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>out</span> again -- I later found out --
my heart stopped and I had to be</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>revived</span>. After three hours in
emergency I was taken to a ward. I spent</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>all</span> night vomiting and shaking.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I beg anyone considering suicide NOT to try this method.
It's scary,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>humiliating</span>, hard to imagine
feeling much worse...and of course it</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>didn't</span> work.</p>
