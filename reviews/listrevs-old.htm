Editorial Reviews</b></big><br>
From Kirkus Reviews , January 15, 1999<br>
This is essentially a guide on how to commit suicide, or alternatively, stage
a ``safe'' suicidal gesture. Stone (who has studied pharmacology at George
Washington University Medical School and the National Institutes of Health)
offers little background, personal, occupational, educational, familial,
religious, or otherwise which might help readers absorb this work into some
kind of useful discussion. Stone does set out his basic premises: first,
that it is each person's right to make decisions concerning his own death,
and second, that most decisions to commit suicide are due to temporary problems
and are therefore tragic mistakes.'' Stone goes on, in a pragmatic, almost
cold-blooded, tone to set out an immense amount of information on suicide
and attempted suicide. He delineates four groups of people who attempt to
kill themselves: rational people facing an insoluble problem, usually fatal
illness; those acting on impulse, temporarily miserable and often drunk;
those who are irrational due to depression, schizophrenia, or alcoholism;
and those who are making a desperate bid for attention or help. Stone also
looks at issues around terminal illness and euthanasia. In Part II, he explains
the following methods of killing oneself: asphyxia, cutting and stabbing,
drowning, drugs, chemicals, poisons, electrocution, gunshot, strangulation,
hypothermia, and jumping. He includes explicit instructions on how to go
about each method, and what the likely physiological damage will be if the
attempt fails. Difficult as all this is to take in, there is more information
on how to make a relatively safe suicidal gesture will certainly confound
readers, as will descriptions of autopsy results and asides on the strange
and various ways people hurt themselves. The technical information here is
accurate. But to approach such a stunningly painful, morally loaded, politically
hot subject constructively, we need more than information. We need to know
who our guide is, how he has come to this place, how and why his view was
formed. -- Copyright &copy;1999, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.<br>

Journal of the American Medical Association, Dec 8, 1999; Ezra E. H. Griffith,
MD; Yale University <br>
At least Geo Stone tells it to you plainly in the introduction to his text.
If you are terminally ill, he wants to give you information that will help
you determine the best way to kill yourself no mincing of words here. He
emphasizes self-determination&#8230;Unhesitatingly, he makes it clear that each
competent individual has the right to figure out how and when to die. He
has no solace to offer should you disagree with his political stance...But
you shouldn't conclude that he's encouraging you to kill yourself not so...
<br>
...Stone thus spends about 145 pages initially constructing a background
on suicide and its derivatives, euthanasia and assisted suicide. His crucial
point, made repeatedly, is that there is too much misguided emphasis on making
people live longer. This is not out of any humanistic commitment to people
but, rather, out of a rigid adherence to ethics-based principles that simply
ignore the degree and extent of suffering some people are experiencing. <br>
This is the background to be traversed before transitioning to the book's
second part, another 250 pages of stunning details about ten or so methods
of killing yourself, including asphyxia, cutting and stabbing, electrocution,
and jumping, among others. Did you know that it is more effective to shoot
yourself straight through the mouth from front to back than to aim at your
face or under the chin? Stone notes that "people tend to flinch or tilt their
head back at the moment they pull the trigger, changing the direction of
bullet entrance and decreasing the chances of fatal brain damage. . . . "
There is no question that facts like these can make for interesting reading,
and they're provided for every methodology considered. <br>
...Still, this book is about death, baldly put. It assaults the senses even
of physicians. It will shock pastors and teachers and all who preach about
the sanctity of life because few of us are accustomed to talking straightforwardly
and lucidly about the most successful way to die. Stone's almost celebratory
approach to the subject will not win him too many friends. After all, you
won't want to call this book to the attention of your children or other loved
ones while sitting around the dining room table or just before they go off
to university, even if the text itself has intellectual merit. <br>

Author's Look at Suicide May Help Deter It by Susan Schechter <br>
Not everybody who attempts suicide is actually trying to kill him/herself.
Some are just cries for attention, but they may still accidentally be successful
anyway. Suicide and Attempted Suicide: Methods and Consequences looks at
the history of suicide, how it's done, and what the outcome -- intended or
not -- might be. <br>
It seems strange to be reviewing a book about suicide, whether it is about
the psychology of suicide (called suicidology) or how to commit suicide.
But Suicide and Attempted Suicide: Methods and Consequences, by Geo Stone,
explains both topics and more. The first half discusses the history of suicide,
from the earliest recorded cases both biblical and historical, though modern
times. It also covers the psychology and sociology of suicide. The second
half reads like a clinical version of Final Exit. And with this bit, the
author does the impossible &#8211; convinces people not to end their lives. <br>
Stone wrote this book with the purpose of preventing suicide. By describing
in clinical, graphic, medical, and gory detail all the different ways to
go, the reader cannot help but shudder and get grossed out. And realize that
is far more difficult to shuffle off this mortal coil than they may have
previously thought. <br>
I must confess, I bought this book a year ago in hardcover, at a major bookstore
chain. A friend of mine, an old boyfriend actually, had committed suicide,
and I , like anyone who has been left behind by someone who has died by their
own hand, was struggling for answers. <br>
Stone takes an attitude much like Dorothy Parker&#8217;s (who was a manic depressive
herself) often quoted poem &#8220;Resume.&#8221; All these ways to die are difficult.
According to the author, 30,000 people kill themselves in the U.S. every
year. <br>
Socrates once said, &#8220;The unexamined life is not worth living.&#8221; The suicidal
mind takes that question and asks, &#8220;What if you have examined your life and
found it to be not worth living?&#8221; People contemplating death is not a new
phenomena. Stone points out there are four suicides in the Old Testament.
There are Egyptian writings going back at least 6,000 years of a man contemplating
his own mortality and suicide. How many suicides are there in Greek tragedies?
All these things are addressed in the first half of the book, in clear language
for the layman. <br>
What is startling about this book is that fact that so many times an attempt
at suicide leads to unintended consequences, namely death, or permanent disability.
Geo Stone states, &#8220;Ignorance is dangerous and desperation can be fatal.&#8221;
The goal of this book is to enlighten, to reduce the number of fatalities
and permanent injuries. By describing all the ways to go, the reader realizes
that it is more difficult than the movies or TV lead us to believe about
dying. It can be quite messy, and if not done correctly, the victim can live
and spend the rest of their lifetime in pain from the botched attempt. The
book also gives clues to look for to deter teenage and elderly suicides,
a growing phenomena. <br>
When I was reading this book I could not help but think of the poet Sylvia
Plath, who I admired terribly when I was a teenager. She, according to her
biographers, was not trying to kill herself when she turned the gas on in
the kitchen of her English flat. She was probably making a cry for help,
being home with two small children, her marriage in tatters, and living in
a country not of her birth. She miscalculated because gas was not in stoves
at that time in the United States. Indeed, had her nanny not been late for
work that day, and the man who lived in the flat below passed out from the
fumes, she might still be here. <br>
This is the kind of person the author is trying to help. The suicidal person
who does not really wants to die, but to go to sleep and wake up again, to
find their problems over. Or the person who is making a cry for help, for
someone to notice them and help them get over these problems. <br>
In short, if this is a topic that is of interest, to anyone who likes psychology,
or is just fascinated on how the human mind works, this book is highly recommended.
But only if you want to know what really goes on in someone&#8217;s mind. <br>

<br>
&nbsp;Not the best book on suicide, but the best on suicide method, March
24, 2000 <br>
Reviewer: A reader from Virginia<br>
As you can see from the range of reader reviews [&#8230;] this is a book about
which it's hard to be neutral. If you think that suicide is always wrong,
a sin, or a crime, you won't like it: the book provides lots of "how-to"
information that can be used to commit suicide. But at the same time there
is an anti-suicide thread running through the text---time and again, the
author suggests delay, alternatives, and medical treatment, so the in-your-face
pro-suicide crowd (small, but vocal) won't be happy either. Further, the
author's website contains, among other things, lots of grisly photos that
seem intended to discourage suicide. <br>
Unlike Gaul, the book is divided into two parts. The first half is an overview
of suicide, covering history, causes of suicide (considered through sociology,
psychiatry, and biology), American and Dutch end-of-life medical practices,
and a few related areas. Compressed into a little over a hundred pages, this
broad coverage is not terribly detailed but functions well as a summary and
is both interesting and well done. <br>
The second half describes, with sometimes weirdly-fascinating factoids, what
is known about suicide methods (the "how-to" part) and their medical consequences
(the "why-you-probably-shouldn't-try-them" part). If you're interested in
suicide methods, this is the best source of information available. If you're
not, there's far more information here than you want to know. Trust me. <br>
The book's layout is poor. References are in the back organized by chapter,
but pages in the text don't have chapter headers, so it's easy to lose your
place, whilst flipping back and forth. Footnotes are at the end of each chapter
instead of at the bottom of the page, another annoying practise, and there
are a surprising number of typso. &lt;g&gt; <br>
In sum, if you want to know why people kill themselves, there are better
sources. If you want to know how, this is your book.<br>

<br>
&nbsp;One of the most in-depth book on the subject, March 30, 1999 <br>
Reviewer: Alvin Ma (see more about me) from California, USA<br>
This book contains some of the most insightful interpretation of statistical
data and superlative research in forensic pathology. <br>
There are two sections in this book. The first section analyzes the social,
psychological and biological aspect of suicide in history and at present
time, in the US and all around the world. There are some powerful conclusions,
such as gun ownership does not necessarily contribute to higher suicide rate,
that are counter-intuitive but extremely convincing. <br>
The second part of the book deals with various suicide methods. The tone
in this section is notably different from the first part, as if it is another
book by another author. Numerous forensic works are quoted here. However,
there are some assertions that seem to me novel and dubious, like the author
states, without reference, that the carotid artery is on the right side of
the neck and the vein is on the left. <br>
While the content of the book is superior, the format is less impressive.
The references of each chapter are bundled together at the end of the book;
and there's no indication on each page which chapter you are in. This makes
it very hard to go from a sentence to its reference. I believe the publisher
should be more considerate about the format of this book. <br>
Nontheless, this is a top-notch, definitive work on the subject, infinitely
better than Mr. Derek Humphry's.<br>

<br>
&nbsp;The most thorough book on the subject. . ., March 6, 1999 <br>
Reviewer: A reader from maryland<br>
This is the definitive book on the subject, exhaustively researched, and
yet quite readable... <br>
As I read this book, I was struck that this is not so much about suicide,
as about self-determination (something the Kirkus reviewer apparently missed).
I began reading this out of a sense of professional obligation, but quickly
found the book surprisingly interesting. There is a wealth of detail presented,
with the solid and sobering information relieved by the often wickedly amusing
(albeit occasionally warped) footnotes. <br>
While the "how to" sections are quite graphic, the reader can readily find
areas of interest through the clear chapter subheadings, and thereby skip
those that might be either too gory or too technical. But the detail presented
is here out of necessity-for how else can the individual make an informed
decision? <br>
This book clearly does not advocate suicide. It provides individuals with
the information to make a better decision about their future. For example,
if someone wishes to make a gesture, it gives them guidance about appropriate
choices that will not leave them off in an even worse state. <br>
As a physician, I was a bit put off by the author's criticism of docs. I
think he underestimates the chilling effect the threat of professional criticism
and repercussions has. Of course, there is also the effect fear of more serious
legal action (eg charges of murder) has on the willingness of physicians
to be more active in this area. This extends to efforts in the area of pain
relief (such as by providing adequate doses of morphine) which are often
inappropriately criticized as excessive. Also, as he notes, docs have been
very poorly educated regarding pain control. <br>
I highly recommend this thorough reference work, the most definitive work
I have seen on this controversial subject. It is far more than a "how to"
manual. It is both a reference book, as well as a thoughtful resource, providing
objective information, historical information, and perspective on this difficult
topic.<br>

&nbsp;No fuss, down to earth. Lot of curious information., August 31, 2001
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Reviewer: zzzshopper (see more about me) from Seattle,
WA USA <br>
I'd say, if you wanna kill yourself some time soon, that book will help you
to pick the most efficient method. If you plan to "make a gesture" it'll
prevent you from going overboard and actually killing yourself instead of
simply striking a posture as intended. <br>
Otoh, if you don't intend anything as dramatic, then still one can pick a
lot of amazing information and stats from it, plus it's very easy to read,
contains no hifalutin touchy-feely sermonizing whatsoever, could be somewhat
helpful in discerning if anyone around you has set his mind on a premarure
departure (though it's by no means a main focus of the book), so all in all,
I'd say it's a curious book and at the very least is bound to gratify every
man's natural curiosity about this somewhat macabre topic. The book looks
thicker than it is because of the bibliography and notes. There's a lot of
notes in it, just as interesting as the text itself. The author expresses
himself with a kind of dry humor that makes the book even more readable.
Not a must-read, but the appropriately curious will not be disappointed.

&nbsp;If you want information about suicide methods, this is it., February
21, 1999 <br>
Reviewer: A reader from Washington, DC<br>
This is an odd, idiosyncratic, fascinating, uneven, irritating, and important
book: there's nothing out there like it. "Suicide and Attempted Suicide"
is primarily a study of suicide methods---how people try to kill themselves
(or, more often, try to get attention or help). It reads as if it were written
by more than one author, or over an extended period of time: the tone bounces
unpredictably from didactic to ironic to funny (be sure to read the chapter
endnotes!). <br>
The first half of the book touches on a wide range of suicide topics: history
of suicide, the legal situation, treatment options, terminal illness, philosophical
issues, euthanasia and assisted suicide. The information is interesting and
well enough presented, but tries to cover too much ground in too few pages.
A reader unfamiliar with this material will find it a reasonable, though
patchy, introduction that can be followed up from the author's well-chosen
"suggested reading" list. <br>
The heart of the book is the second half, where it discusses suicide methods
and their consequences in clinical detail. This treatment will surely be
controversial, since the author provides "how to" (and "how not to") information
that can be used either to commit suicide or to carry out a suicidal gesture.
<br>
I've seen only one other book that takes a similar approach, Derek Humphry's
"Final Exit" to which this book will inevitably be compared. "Suicide and
Attempted Suicide" is the far more comprehensive and detailed work, which
is both its strength and its weakness. There is no better---in fact no other---book
that discusses the variety of suicide methods in any significant depth. However
the large amount of information comes at a cost: a suicidal reader may have
a hard time extracting the data he wants from the mass of data he doesn't
need. Similarly, the casual reader will probably find the quantity and details
of evidence overwhelming. <br>
The writing style is rather pedestrian, which doesn't detract much from a
book of this sort, but occasionally slips into "medicalese" which does. On
the other hand there are quite a few interesting and informative asides and
digressions. These range from early Christian theological disputes, to minimizing
heat loss in marine mammals, to the words of Jim Jones (remember Jonestown?)
at an anti-suicide rally in San Francisco. <br>
Given the sometimes-gory descriptions, the absence of photos and drawings
is a bit surprising. However the author says in a "note to the reader" that
these will be available on his website. <br>
Overall, flaws and all, I highly recommend this book for anyone who has seriously
considered suicide, or is presently contemplating it. With more reservations---the
first half has too little detail, the second half too much---I would recommend
it for general readers as well.<br>

&nbsp;Stays with you, July 7, 2000 <br>
Reviewer: A reader from USA<br>
This is clearly the work of a man deeply steeped in his own moral compass
which is nothing but laudable. I would say it is worth reading this book
simply for it's strength of character; as an example of what happens when
someone looks deeply into a social phenomenon, then deeply into their soul,
then expresses the result in a clear, concise way. <br>
Yes this book is challenging to the reader: if you have ANY fear of some
means of death or injury (who doesn't?) then there will be some part of the
book that defies you to keep staring at the clinical reality of the situation.
<br>
Yet Stone makes his case with emotion, feeling and yes, humor -- but never
without the utmost respect for those considering suicide or those reaching
for help in a desperate act. Never once did I feel Stone was judging the
subject or the reader. He saved all that for the system and those that perpetuate
it. <br>
I read this book a year ago and it's principles have stayed with me and inspired
me to me more open, generous and thoughtful. <br>
Thanks.<br>

&nbsp;A laudable but incomplete work., June 25, 2000 <br>
Reviewer: A reader from Wichita, Kansas<br>
That this is called the most complete suicide how-to book indicates just
how little information is available. Rather than being authoritative, this
book would merely make an attempt even more frightening, given its insufficient
and vague instructions. <br>
The book offers little information outside common knowlege and mainly serves
to emphasize the consequences of a failed attempt. The few statistics quoted
are of small sample sizes and are not geographically spread, there are no
diagrams, descriptions are colorless and technical information is incomplete.
The author fails, for instance, to note that lethality of firearms is as
dependent upon type of cartridge and bullet as upon calibre (imagine someone
confidently using a .357 magnum pistol inadvertently loaded with low velocity
.38 special cartridges). <br>
To be fair, perhaps the stigma against suicide, and career considerations
caused the author's sources to be reluctant to offer information or advice.
This might explain why so much of the book seems gleaned from internet dilettantes.
The book is still a brave first effort, made at some personal risk, and the
author should be commended for performing something of a public service.<br>

&nbsp;The "How-To" Manual on Suicide, April 21, 2000 <br>
Reviewer: Michael Godfrey from United States<br>
Ever since I was young, I've been chemically predisposed to depression. As
I got older, these feelings deepened and were fed with the artistic curve
in my personality, but I've never sought chemical, psychotropic treatment
as I'd rather learn the root of my issues and find resolution. <br>
Now having read the work of Geo Stone, a very clinical, white light is shed
on the mystery and attraction that is suicide. Dry humor, at times, is used,
as this is a heavy subject, but it still abounds with the reality that "when
you point the gun properly, as the author will instruct, that is it..." <br>
No longer do I find room for curiosity or the enigmatic romance. In that
sense, then, I have learned that suicide isn't something only impacting the
self. The book showed me how others are left with a hole in their life. <br>
I do wish there were more historical information regarding the Catholic Church
and Christianity in it's developed stance on the moral issues. It did cover
early Christianity and the short lived period of suicides in order to bypass
the temptations of earth to get one's seat in heaven, but I would love to
have read more. <br>
Also fascinating were the situational ethics brought up by the author compelling
one to really analyze if there truly is anything "sinful" about suicide.
In one instance, murder during war is honorable....suicide is not. Other
examples and contrasts made by the author borderline on the profound where
one can actually walk away feeling neither "pro" nor "against" suicide. <br>
For years, I was a Catholic Benedictine Monk, and do know what the Church
dictates on this subject, but I no longer am in agreement with this opinion.
Nothing in life is black and white. Nothing is easy. <br>
If you want this book to offend you, it will. If you wish to be challenged,
emotionally and ethically, it will. It simply is how you wish to see it.
<br>
Through confrontation and suffering, we grow as human beings. This is the
basis of the Paschal Mystery of Christ. <br>

&nbsp;SICKENING, February 20, 2000 <br>
Reviewer: A reader from USA<br>
Why would anyone want to write a book on ways to kill ones self? I found
this book quite nauseating, mainly because suicide is the one sin that cannot
be forgiven by God, the taking of one's own life is unforgivable, and a definate
ticket to Hell, where your suffering will be unimaginable, and FOREVER. I
am not trying to preach it just saddens me so, that a book like this is even
allowed to be published, what about the families and friends of people who
take their own lives? It stays in their minds and hearts forever. If you
are thinking about suicide or harming yourself, why not try to get help?
Call a friend or family member, talk to a minister or someone who serves
the Lord, go talk to a doctor, there are many types of medication now days
to help with depression and social phobias. Please don't take your life over
a temporary problem, because you will have to face the consequences for a
lifetime.<br>

&nbsp;book withouth star, August 21, 1999 <br>
Reviewer: A reader from jaen- spain<br>
I can't judge books as this in one only sense: good - bad, one- five stars,
etc. because suicide is very serious thing, and the serious things of life
accustoms to be ambivalent. Certainly, not all people has much to leave,
not all were loved, but curiously, suicide is rarely committed in underenveloped,
miserable countries when rates of "natural" death are very high. So, this
book is good in the sense it's technically worth, but I think it are intended
for countries of the first world when one theoretically will have not so
many reasons for taking her life. Or perhaps yes, because the advances of
medicine that prolongs life but at some cases one asks himself: "for what?".
I'm Spanish and no doubt my point of view can't be the same as a Northamerican,
but as it were, I can't condemn suicide nor this book, but this not means
it likes me as many other facts in this world. It's valid because is very
rational (it need to be), but we humans are only partially rational beings:
perhaps less that is commonly thinked. At catholic cultures there's the custom
to speak one thing, while thinking other, and doing another. And there's
always the catholic absolution. Also, I have read that in the state of Kansas,
rigth now, teaching theory of evolution at schools is forbidden. I think
that there's an error, but it seems that Darwin himself understood that people
couldn't like to be reduced to the cathegory of only an ape. Well, perhaps
I'm disgressing. All I believe is that if society is too much tolerant with
suicide, people will have it in mind as a little more easy, normal possibility,
but the first rule of life is living, not dying. Having this book at reach
of hand for "what it would be" I feel is bad, and treating to assure excessively
the life against all contingencies is resting life to own life, and this
can generate people yet dead before his end. The whole of us traverse circunstancial
bad moments, and with the exception of those suffering unsupportable disease,
painful old age, loneliness, insanity or poverty (sure they are many), suicide
is commited in sudden disperation, so, the suicide takes not the time of
reading none. Only perhaps at some times and particular cultures this is
not so, and suicide could be not so rare part of his customs. I think yes:
one has the rigth to take his life under exceptional circunstances, and if
he don't know how to do safely and without pain, this book is worthwile.
But presenting suicide as other vulgar or routine custom isn't good and a
sign of decadence, or, perhaps worst, the beginnig of one of these monstruous
utopias described by Zamyatin, Kafka, Huxley, Orwell and many others.<br>

&nbsp; One of the most engaging books I've read., October 5, 2001 <br>
Reviewer: Meaghan Good (see more about me) from Venedocia, Ohio USA <br>
This is a really neat book. Well-researched, informative, often funny. Many
such books have a very dry tone, but not this one. I read it more-or-less
continuously for a whole day to finish it. I love the footnotes. I think
it might be dangerous in the hands of a suicidal person, since it tells all
about how to do yourself in, but it's good for someone like me who's only
interested in the theory.<br>
&nbsp;No fuss, down to earth. Lot of curious information., August 31, 2001

I'd say, if you wanna kill yourself some time soon, that book will help you
to pick the most efficient method. If you plan to "make a gesture" it'll
prevent you from going overboard and actually killing yourself instead of
simply striking a posture as intended. <br>
Otoh, if you don't intend anything as dramatic, then still one can pick a
lot of amazing information and stats from it, plus it's very easy to read,
contains no hifalutin touchy-feely sermonizing whatsoever, could be somewhat
helpful in discerning if anyone around you has set his mind on a premarure
departure (though it's by no means a main focus of the book), so all in all,
I'd say it's a curious book and at the very least is bound to gratify every
man's natural curiosity about this somewhat macabre topic. The book looks
thicker than it is because of the bibliography and notes. There's a lot of
notes in it, just as interesting as the text itself. The author expresses
himself with a kind of dry humor that makes the book even more readable.
Not a must-read, but the appropriately curious will not be disappointed.

&nbsp;Neutral guide if you want to decide, August 23, 2001 <br>
Reviewer: Herwig Syen from Reykjavik, Iceland <br>
Geo Stone gives you the plain facts. Sometimes it gets a little tedious to
read the statistics and some of them are outdated. I'm sure he researched
for the newest material though. The essence of the book is: Why do people
commit suicide, Can it be prevented? If not, how do you go about it. It is
bound to shock, but it gives a very objective view about a sensitive subject.
Thumbs up!<br>

&nbsp;Basically a primer for the suicidal, March 29, 2001 <br>
Reviewer: willster1 (see more about me) from Dallas, TX <br>
This book is bound to offend some people. It provides detailed information
on the most effective ways to commit suicide and, conversely, the safest
ways to stage a cry for help in the form of attempted suicide. The book is
an odd combination of well-written information and dry statistics. For those
who are interested in the psychological, sociological and physical manifestations
of suicide in America, this book is the definitve guide. --This text refers
