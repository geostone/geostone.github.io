<LI><B>Why pictures?</B> <BR>
<P>Some things can't be adequately described in words. If that doesn't answer 
your question, try: To inform would-be suicides---people should know what 
they're getting into. 
<P>
<P><BR></P>
<LI><B>Why these pictures?</B> <BR>
<P>Some of them are poor quality (generally scans of photocopies of 
not-very-good medical images), but may still illustrate the intended 
point/information. They will be replaced if, when, and as I find others. Feel 
free to send better ones to me, or point me to them. <BR>
<P>
<P></P>
<LI><B>Why so many pictures?</B> <BR>
<P>Part of what I'm trying to do is to show potential suicides what's likely to 
happen. I really don't know if "more" is better, worse, or irrelevant for that 
purpose, but I'd rather err on the side of too much than too little. <BR>
<P>
<P></P>
<LI><B>Why so gory?</B> <BR>
<P>If anything, many of the photos are not graphic enough, as a number of them 
were cleaned up for their original forensic purpose, and they are less realistic 
for "what-might-happen-if-you-do-this" purposes. <BR>
<P>
<P></P>
<LI><B>Why not only suicide pictures?</B> <BR>
<P>While I'm trying to show the effects of suicide attempts, the physical 
results are similar to homicide or accident by the same 
means. In addition, many of the trauma images found on the web don't specify 
suicide/homicide/accident.
